# Global Insurance Policies Analysis - SQL

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **global insurance policies** data using **MySQL**. The data includes information about **policies**, **claims**, **payments**, **customers**, and **agents**. The aim is to derive meaningful insights and trends that can help insurance companies understand customer behavior, assess agent performance, and identify opportunities for business growth.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyzing insurance policies, claims, and customer data.
- Identifying trends in claims, payments, and customer retention.
- Generating insights on agent performance and policy profitability.
- Using raw **SQL queries** to perform comprehensive analysis.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: For managing the database and performing complex queries.
- **SQL Queries**: Used for extracting insights, aggregating data, and cleaning the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Focused on cleaning and structuring data for effective analysis.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Claims Analysis**: Understanding the frequency and type of claims based on policy types and geographical locations.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Insights into the revenue generated by different types of insurance policies and regions.
- **Agent Performance**: Evaluating agent productivity based on the number of policies sold and claims processed.
- **Customer Retention**: Analyzing customer retention rates and identifying potential churn risks.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying seasonal patterns in claims and payments.

## 🔄 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to:
1. Install **MySQL** on your local machine.
2. Have access to the **dataset** provided in the `data/` folder or load your own insurance dataset into the database.

### Steps to Execute:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   First, clone the repository to your local machine by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devikonni/Global-Insurance-Policies-Analysis-with-MYSQL
   cd Global-Insurance-Policies-Analysis-with-MYSQL
   ## 🔄 How to Run the Project

2. **Import the dataset**:  
   To load the data, use the following SQL query (this may vary depending on your dataset format):
   ```sql
   LOAD DATA INFILE '/path_to_your_data.csv' 
   INTO TABLE policies
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' 
   IGNORE 1 ROWS;
3.** Run SQL queries:**
  Open and execute the SQL queries from the queries/ folder in your MySQL environment.
  These queries include detailed analysis on claims, policies, revenue, customer retention, and agent performance.

  For example, open the queries/revenue_analysis.sql file and run it in your MySQL environment.

4.**View the results:**
   After running the queries, you will get valuable insights into the insurance business, such as claim patterns, agent performance, customer retention trends, etc.
   You can view the results directly within the MySQL interface.

## 🗂️ Project Structure**
