# Global Insurance Policies Analysis - SQL

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **global insurance policies** data using **MySQL**. The data includes information about **policies**, **claims**, **payments**, **customers**, and **agents**. The aim is to derive meaningful insights and trends that can help insurance companies understand customer behavior, assess agent performance, and identify opportunities for business growth.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyzing insurance policies, claims, and customer data.
- Identifying trends in claims, payments, and customer retention.
- Generating insights on agent performance and policy profitability.
- Using raw **SQL queries** to perform comprehensive analysis.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: For managing the database and performing complex queries.
- **SQL Queries**: Used for extracting insights, aggregating data, and cleaning the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Focused on cleaning and structuring data for effective analysis.

## üîë Key Insights

- **Claims Analysis**: Understanding the frequency and type of claims based on policy types and geographical locations.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Insights into the revenue generated by different types of insurance policies and regions.
- **Agent Performance**: Evaluating agent productivity based on the number of policies sold and claims processed.
- **Customer Retention**: Analyzing customer retention rates and identifying potential churn risks.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying seasonal patterns in claims and payments.

## üîÑ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to:
1. Install **MySQL** on your local machine.
2. Have access to the **dataset** provided in the `data/` folder or load your own insurance dataset into the database.

### Steps to Execute:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Devikonni/Global-Insurance-Policies-Analysis-with-MYSQL

   Import the dataset:

Use MySQL Workbench or any MySQL interface to load the dataset into your local MySQL server. 
The dataset is located in the data/ folder of the repository.

 
-- Example SQL to load the dataset (this will vary depending on your dataset format)
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path_to_your_data.csv'
INTO TABLE policies
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
Run the SQL queries:

Open and execute the queries from the queries/ folder in your MySQL environment. These queries include detailed analysis on claims, policies, revenue, customer retention, and agent performance.

View the results:

The output of these queries will provide you with valuable insights into various aspects of the insurance business, such as claim patterns, agent performance, customer retention trends, etc.
